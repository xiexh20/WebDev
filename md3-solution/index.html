                        Andrew Yao, Turing Award winner in 2000, in recognition of his fundamental contributions to the theory of computation, including the complexity-based theory of pseudorandom number generation, cryptography, and communication complexity. He was an assistant
                        professor at MIT (1975–1976), assistant professor at Stanford University (1976–1981), and professor at the University of California, Berkeley (1981–1982).[4] From 1982 to 1986, he was a full professor at Stanford University.[5]
                        From 1986 to 2004, he was the William and Edna Macaleer Professor of Engineering and Applied Science at Princeton University,[6] where he continued to work on algorithms and complexity. In 2004, he became a Professor of the Center
                        for Advanced Study, Tsinghua University (CASTU) and the Director of the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS), Tsinghua University in Beijing. Since 2010, he has served as the Dean of Institute for Interdisciplinary
                        Information Sciences (IIIS) in Tsinghua University. He is also the Distinguished Professor-at-Large in the Chinese University of Hong Kong.[7]

                        Manuel Blum, Turing Award winner in 1995, in recognition of his contributions to the foundations of computational complexity theory and its application to cryptography and program checking. He worked as a professor of computer science at the University
                        of California, Berkeley until 2001. From 2001 to 2018, he was the Bruce Nelson Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where his wife, Lenore Blum,[10] was also a professor of Computer Science. In 2002 he was
                        elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. In 2018 he and his wife Lenore resigned from Carnegie Mellon University to protest against sexism after a change in management structure of Project Olympus led to sexist
                        treatment of her as director and the exclusion of other women from project activities.

                        Robert W. Floyd, Turing Awrd winner in 1978, For having a clear influence on methodologies for the creation of efficient and reliable software, and for helping to found the following important subfields of computer science: the theory of parsing, the
                        semantics of programming languages, automatic program verification, automatic program synthesis, and analysis of algorithms.

                        Born in New York City, Floyd finished high school at age 14. At the University of Chicago, he received a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in liberal arts in 1953 (when still only 17) and a second bachelor's degree in physics in 1958. Floyd was a college roommate
                        of Carl Sagan.[2] Floyd became a staff member of the Armour Research Foundation (now IIT Research Institute) at Illinois Institute of Technology in the 1950s. Becoming a computer operator in the early 1960s, he began publishing
                        many papers, including on compilers (particularly parsing). He was a pioneer of operator-precedence grammars, and is credited with initiating the field of programming language semantics in Floyd (1967). He was appointed an associate
                        professor at Carnegie Mellon University by the time he was 27 and became a full professor at Stanford University six years later. He obtained this position without a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. He was a member of the International
                        Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which supports and maintains the programming languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68.[3] He was elected a Fellow of the American
                        Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974.[4] He received the Turing Award in 1978 "for having a clear influence on methodologies for the creation of efficient and reliable software, and for helping to found the following important
                        subfields of computer science: the theory of parsing, the semantics of programming languages, automatic program verification, automatic program synthesis, and analysis of algorithms". Floyd worked closely with Donald Knuth, in
                        particular as the major reviewer for Knuth's seminal book The Art of Computer Programming, and is the person most cited in that work. He was co-author, with Richard Beigel, of the textbook The Language of Machines: an Introduction
                        to Computability and Formal Languages.[5]

                        Ivan Sutherlan, Turing Award winner in 1988, for his pioneering and visionary contributions to computer graphics, starting with Sketchpad, and continuing after. His early work in computer graphics as well as his teaching with David C. Evans in that subject
                        at the University of Utah in the 1970s was pioneering in the field. Sutherland, Evans, and their students from that era developed several foundations of modern computer graphics. He received the Turing Award from the Association
                        for Computing Machinery in 1988 for the invention of Sketchpad, an early predecessor to the sort of graphical user interface that has become ubiquitous in personal computers. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering,
                        as well as the National Academy of Sciences among many other major awards. In 2012 he was awarded the Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology for "pioneering achievements in the development of computer graphics and interactive interfaces".
