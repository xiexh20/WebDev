                <p class="styled">Wild potato species, originating in modern-day Peru, can be found throughout the Americas, 
                    from the United States to southern Chile.[3] The potato was originally believed to have 
                    been domesticated by indigenous peoples of the Americas independently in multiple locations,[4] 
                    but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species traced a single 
                    origin for potatoes. In the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia, 
                    from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex, potatoes were domesticated approximately 7,000–10,000 
                    years ago.[5][6][7] In the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous, some close 
                    relatives of the potato are cultivated.</p>

                <span id="tomato" class="srec"> Tomato</span>
                <p class="styled">The tomato is the edible, often red, berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum,[2][1] commonly known as 
                    a tomato plant. The species originated in western South America and Central America.[2][3] The Nahuatl
                     (the language used by the Aztecs) word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the 
                     English word tomato derived.[3][4] Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated
                      with the indigenous peoples of Mexico.[2][5] The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time 
                      of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the 
                      first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe. From there, the 
                      tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.

                <span id="banana" class="srec"> Banana</span>
                <p class="styled">A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry[1][2] – produced by several kinds of large 
                    herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.[3] In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be 
                    called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color, 
                    and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind,
                     which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging 
                     from the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) bananas come from two 
                     wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. </p>
